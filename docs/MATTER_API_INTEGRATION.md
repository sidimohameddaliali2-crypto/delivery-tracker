# Matter API integration

This app reads live subscription/nutrition/delivery data from Matter's own
backend (the website people subscribe through) and, in one place, writes to
it (pausing a subscription's deliveries). It's the source of truth for a
customer's macros, meal plan, snacks/day, breakfast inclusion, delivery
address/window, and subscription status — the internal `Customer` collection
in this app never duplicates that data long-term; it only caches it and
cross-references it.

- External API base URL: `https://backend-v2.matternutrition.xyz/api/v1`
- Auth: static bearer token, not a per-user login
- Code: `server/services/matterApiService.js` (the only place that calls
  Matter directly), `server/routes/matterApi.js` (exposes a subset to the
  authenticated client app), `server/services/matterNutritionLookup.js`
  (stale-subscription-id fallback, see below)

## 1. Configuration

Set in `server/.env` (or `.env.local` to override):

```
MATTER_API_BASE_URL=https://backend-v2.matternutrition.xyz/api/v1
MATTER_API_TOKEN=<bearer token>
```

If either is missing, `matterApiService.client()` throws immediately
(`Matter API is not configured...`) rather than making a request with no
auth — every call site should expect that error and surface it, not retry.

## 2. Calling it from server code

Always go through `matterApiService` (default export, already instantiated —
`import matterApiService from '../services/matterApiService.js'`). Never call
`axios` against Matter directly from a route; the service centralizes auth,
the 15s timeout, and error-message formatting.

| Method | What it does | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listSubscriptions({ page, pageSize, email, customerId, updatedSince })` | One page of subscriptions (list/summary fields only — no macros, no address detail) | 1 call |
| `getSubscription(subscriptionId)` | Full detail for one subscription — macros, plan, addresses, delivery_schedule, exclusions, everything | 1 call |
| `getSubscriptionNutritionByEmail(email)` | Macros/calories/snacks/plan/meal_frequency/breakfast_included/addresses/delivery_window/exclusions/name/phone for the subscription matching this email | 2 calls (list then detail), **cached 15 min** per email |
| `getSubscriptionNutritionBySubscriptionId(subscriptionId)` | Same shape, looked up directly by subscription id (for a customer manually linked via `Customer.matterSubscriptionId` because their internal email doesn't match Matter) | 1 call, **cached 15 min** per subscription id |
| `getSubscriptionPauses(subscriptionId)` | Current pause state for a subscription | 1 call |
| `createSubscriptionPause(subscriptionId, { pausedDays, chosenDays, reason })` | **Writes.** Reschedules real deliveries — 1-for-1 swap, `pausedDays`/`chosenDays` must be equal length. Sends a fresh `Idempotency-Key` per call | 1 call |
| `listAllSubscriptions()` | Pages through the whole subscription list (list-level fields only) | N calls (~1 per 100 subscriptions) |
| `findSubscriptionsWithDeliveryInRange(startDateKey, endDateKey)` / `findSubscriptionsWithDeliveryOnDate(dateKey)` | Every active/paused/cancelled-but-still-owed subscription with a scheduled delivery in that date range, per its own `delivery_schedule` | Expensive — full detail fetch for every candidate subscription, concurrency 20. On-demand only, never on page load |
| `listActiveCustomerContacts()` | name/email/phone/address for every active subscription | Expensive — full detail for every active subscription. On-demand only |
| `listActiveSubscriptionFinancials()` | `gross_paid`/`currency` per active subscription | Expensive, on-demand only |
| `listActiveSubscriptionAnalytics()` | plan name/created date/zone per active subscription | Expensive, on-demand only |

Anything marked "expensive" exists because Matter's list endpoint doesn't
carry the field you need — there's no bulk endpoint for macros, addresses, or
delivery schedule, so getting that data for many subscriptions means one
detail call per subscription. Don't call these from a request that runs on
every page load; they're meant for export buttons / admin-triggered reports.

### Error handling

```js
import matterApiService, { describeMatterApiError } from '../services/matterApiService.js';

try {
  const data = await matterApiService.getSubscription(id);
} catch (error) {
  const message = describeMatterApiError(error) || 'fallback message';
  // ...
}
```

`describeMatterApiError` turns Matter's `{ error: { code, message } }`
response shape into readable text, with two codes specifically handled:
`UNAUTHENTICATED` (bad/missing token) and `WRITE_NOT_ALLOWED` (pause writes
are currently restricted to a single pilot customer on Matter's side).

### Resolving "which address do I deliver to"

A subscription can have several saved addresses. Use
`selectBestAddress(subscription.customer_addresses)` — it picks the one
flagged `current_delivery_address: true`, falling back to the most complete
active/primary address if none is flagged. Don't just take
`customer_addresses[0]`.

### Stale `matterSubscriptionId` (subscription renewals)

When a customer renews, Matter can issue a **new** subscription id — the old
one then 404s. Don't call `getSubscriptionNutritionBySubscriptionId` directly
for a customer with a manual link; go through
`getNutritionForLinkedSubscription(subscriptionId, email)`
(`server/services/matterNutritionLookup.js`) instead. On a 404 it retries by
email, and if that finds a different (newer) subscription id, it relinks
every `Customer` still pointing at the dead id — so the next lookup goes
straight to the right one, with no manual re-linking needed in Customer
Management.

### Caching

`getSubscriptionNutritionByEmail`/`BySubscriptionId` cache their result in
Redis (`config/cache.js`, `cacheGet`/`cacheSet`) for 15 minutes — shared
across every browser tab/staff member, not per-session. Macro/plan data
changes on the order of days, not minutes, so this is safe; a customer who
edits their plan on Matter's site may take up to 15 minutes to show the new
values in Kitchen List. Cached on success only — a `null`/not-found result is
never cached, so a customer who gets a subscription mid-shift isn't locked
out.

## 3. Internal HTTP routes (for the client app)

Mounted at `/api/matter` (`server/routes/matterApi.js`), all behind the
normal staff JWT (`protect` — see `middleware/auth.js`), none of these are
public:

| Route | Maps to | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /subscriptions` | `listSubscriptions` | Subscriptions list page |
| `GET /subscriptions/nutrition-by-email?email=` | `getSubscriptionNutritionByEmail` | Kitchen List/Counting nutrition enrichment |
| `GET /subscriptions/nutrition-by-subscription-id?subscriptionId=&email=` | `getNutritionForLinkedSubscription` | Same, for manually-linked customers |
| `GET /subscriptions/delivery-on-date?date=&dateTo=` | `findSubscriptionsWithDeliveryInRange` | Kitchen auto-populate-missing job |
| `GET /subscriptions/all` | `listAllSubscriptions` | Subscriptions list status tabs, Reports counts |
| `GET /subscriptions/financials` | `listActiveSubscriptionFinancials` | Subscription & Sales dashboard |
| `GET /subscriptions/analytics` | `listActiveSubscriptionAnalytics` | Customer Analytics & Reports |
| `GET /subscriptions/active-contacts` | `listActiveCustomerContacts` | Contacts export |
| `GET /subscriptions/:id` | `getSubscription` | Subscription detail view |
| `GET /subscriptions/:id/pauses` | `getSubscriptionPauses` | Subscription detail view |
| `POST /subscriptions/:id/pauses` | `createSubscriptionPause` | Skip-a-delivery-day flow (menu selection link) |

Every route responds `{ success, data }` on success and
`{ success: false, message, error }` on failure, with the upstream Matter
HTTP status forwarded when available (so a Matter 404 reaches the client as
a 404, not a generic 500).

## 4. Cross-referencing Matter subscriptions with internal customers

Matter has no concept of this app's internal `Customer` records — matching
one to the other (so Kitchen List can pull live macros for a customer who
only exists internally, or so a menu-selection sign-in can find a
subscription by email) is handled separately by
`server/services/customerMatchService.js` (manual link → email → phone →
name cascade) — see that file's own comments, not duplicated here.

## 5. Known gotchas (learned the hard way, keep in mind before changing this code)

- **`meal_frequency` vs `total_meals`**: `subscription.plan.meal_frequency` is
  the per-day meal count; `subscription.total_meals` is for the whole
  billing cycle. Don't divide the wrong one by days.
- **`cancelled` subscriptions can still be owed deliveries.** A `cancelled`
  status means the customer won't renew, not that service stopped — they're
  owed deliveries through `cycle_end_date`. Every place that filters by
  subscription status (`findSubscriptionsWithDeliveryInRange`, etc.) includes
  `cancelled` alongside `active`/`paused`, gated on `cycle_end_date`, never
  excluded outright.
- **`subscription_status: 'paused'` doesn't mean every day is skipped** — the
  per-day `delivery_schedule[].status` is the real source of truth for
  whether a specific date has an active delivery.
- **List rows can be sparser than detail.** The list/summary endpoint's
  `name`/`email` can be blank even when the full detail record has them —
  bulk matching code prefers `detail.data.name`/`detail.data.email`, falling
  back to the list row only if detail has nothing either.
