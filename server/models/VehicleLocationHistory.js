// Owner (2026-10-09): "I want to collect historical data... save the point
// the driver are doing" — Truckoom's own API has no route-trail/playback
// endpoint (confirmed by exhaustively checking their docs), so this app
// builds its own history by sampling server/jobs/recordVehicleLocations.js
// every minute and keeping every point (no automatic purge — owner chose
// "keep forever"). driver is a point-in-time snapshot of whichever User was
// mapped to this vehicleNo at the moment it was recorded (via
// User.profile.truckoomVehicleNo) — kept even if that mapping later changes,
// so old points still show who was driving at the time.
